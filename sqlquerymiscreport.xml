	<!--
		The SQL in these maps files has purposely been typed with more
		verbosity than is actually required. For example, many of the selects
		could have just used SELECT * FROM... instead of listing all of the
		columns. This is to demonstrate that even complex SQL can be handled
		and coded and formatted the way SQL was meant to be (i.e. not a bunch
		of concatenated strings in a Java class).
